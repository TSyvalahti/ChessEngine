# Definition

The aim of this project is to implement minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to create a chess engine powerful enough to beat non-experienced human players. Project is implemented with Java. The engine should also be able to play against itself. In this project the focus will be both in improving depth of engine calculations and boosting raw computing power with position evaluation, as the creator is quite experienced chess player. In this project, chess template done for data structures and algorithms project (University of Helsinki, 2019) is used. Study program: Bachelor of Science.


### Algorithms and data structrures

Chess rules need to be implemented.

### Input and output

Basically the engine takes in a chess position and gives a move as an output.
