# Week 1 Report:

I read carefully through the instructions for the course. I decided to take chess as my theme, as I play it myself quite a lot. I put up a repository for the project. I have familiarized myself with the needed documentations and GitHub usage, as that is quite new to me. The definition document will be more detailed later. 

Time spent: 4h
